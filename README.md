# 🧮 Python Calculator
## 🎯 The Challenge

The purpose of this project is to put into practice what I've learned in Python. I'm currently studying this language, so I took a university challenge and recreated it in Python. The challenge was to build exactly this calculator in the terminal, with these same options, but originally in the programming language VisualG.

## 🛠️ What I've used

I've used the basics of Python, in summary:
- Match & Case
- If & Else
- For & While
- List
- Try & Except
- Input
- Print

## ⚙️ How it works?

The program starts by asking you to choose an option for what you want to calculate. After you choose, it will ask for some values, perform the operation, and then print the result for you. ✅
